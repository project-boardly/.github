## What is a Board?

A board is a LSP8 Collection. Using unlimited metadata, we will store the board arrangements, tokens, metadata and access control conditions for Lit Protocol.

Using the KeyManager, we plan to make boards collaborative. By giving permissions to other people to execute functions on this token to update specific things like arrangement, access control conditions or metadata.

Users can also create there own NFTs and content to put in this board, and they can make it specific to be only visible within this board.

## What is a Universal Follower System?

With the help of LSP1, LSP17 and LSP18, we can update metadata in every user's profile around who are following them and who the user is following. This give the control of followers/following to the user and the data is stored in their Universal Profile.

If not possible/feasible/accepting via LSP1 implementation, we plan to create a custom adapter contract which can enable users to enable the follow system on their profiles.

By configuring extensions, users can start charging their followers a fees and receive the tokens directly in their Profile. The extensions themselves can be upgraded/changed/removed.

## What is a Semi Private Boards

All the access control related details are stored as part of token metadata. This is applicable for any boards that are created by the users or any custom content that is created using this platform.

We plan to build a @erc725/erc725.js general tool for all developers so that they can directly encrypt/decrypt data for a universal profile.

## Wallet Less / Keyless web3 Accounts

There are several tools that are offering key/wallet management tools powered by web2 authentication methods. Lit Protocol also provides this tool to allow users to control their accounts even when using web2 modes of authentication.

We are going to integrate Lit Protocols key management solutions to make onboarding seamless, and yet having a Universal Profile from the moment they sign up for the platform. This is made possible by the power of KeyManager to associate specific permissions to specific keys.
